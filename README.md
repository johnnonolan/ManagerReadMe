# Read(about)Me
Hello, If you're reading this it's likely that I am either your manager, or a prospective team member. This ReadMe should cover some of what to expect when working with me. It's been crafted by me but I've asked for feedback from the people I work with.

# My mission
I care about (in no particular order):
- Making our product better
- Making our team better
- Making you better
- Making me better

If we aren't in a sustained cycle of learning, and making things better, let's change that. Talk to me. *Help me*. If you don't care about these things, then you will struggle to be successful on our team. Don't worry though, if you have the inclination we can turn things around.

# My role as a manager
I'm here to give you the help you need to do your job. This means:
- I gather information early -> to give you context to do your job.
- I observe team dynamics -> to see if we can work smarter.
- I analyse our systems -> to understand where opportunity lies
- I fill in the gaps -> to help when it is needed
- I work with you -> to achieve your goals.

# Availability
I try and be as responsive as possible to any communication, although responses are typically ranked this way:

1. Face to face
2. Pager Duty
3. Slack
4. SMS/phone/none work related messaging platforms.
5. Email

An email to me does not guarantee a timely response. I receive a lot of email and I treat it as an asynchronous medium.

## Out of hours communications
I respect your free time and don't tend to message people outside of work hours. Most things can wait but if you really need to get a hold of me, slack/call/text me. It's cool.

# 1:1s
I want to make these valuable but they are your meetings. If you have an agenda item please bring it up. This is your chance to talk. We will have scheduled 1:1s but if you want to talk ad-hoc, Slack me and I will find time.

# I trust you
Yes, if you are on my team, my default is to trust that you have the tools to do the job in hand. I trust you to keep our systems up and lift our team and products to new heights. If you need anything to help you achieve that goal, let's talk.

# I am human
Which means I inevitably falter.
I'd like to think I'm an honest, straightforward person and because of this I like to know when I'm working well with you and when there's friction. The things written above are part of my guiding principles. If you feel like I am not adhering to the words written above. Or if you don't feel like I am instilling these values in you, _please_ give me that feedback.
